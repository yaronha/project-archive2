# Using MLRun Projects with Archives & GIT

MLRun projects can be stored and versioned in an archive, and they can be loaded and executed in different client or CI/CD environments. Project functions can access code in the repository and use relative paths.

The [**project_archives.ipynb**](project_archives.ipynb) notebook is demonstrating how to:
* Create a new project and register functions
* Load a project from local/remote archive
* Deploy and execute job functions
* Deploy and execute real-time functions
